data attributes
example           overhead 
`s#2 2 3 sorted   0 
`u#2 4 5 unique   16*u 
`p#2 2 1 parted   (4*u;16*u;4*u+1) 
`g#2 1 2 grouped  (4*u;16*u;4*u+1;4*n)

The byte overheads use n(number of elements) and u(number of uniques)
`u is for unique lists.
`p and `g are for lists with a lot of repetition.

`s#, `u# and `g# are preserved on append in memory (if possible)
only `s# is preserved on append to disk
