save/load tables
tables can be written as a single file or spread across a directory, e.g.
`:trade set x      / write as single file 
`:trade/ set x     / write across a directory 
trade:get`:trade   / read 
trade:get`:trade/  / map columns on demand

tables splayed across a directory must be fully enumerated(no varchar) and not keyed.
