kill - killing a q session
If the q session is responsive and listening on a port, you can try connecting 
to it via ipc and calling "exit 0".

kill -9 pid results in an ungraceful exit, and should be used as a last resort.
If kdb+ is responsive, send it SIGTERM, e.g. kill pid
If it is not responsive, send SIGINT, then SIGTERM.
If that doesn't work, and you really have to, then kill -9 pid.

the pid of a q process is .z.i
